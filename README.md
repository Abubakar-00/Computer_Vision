# Computer_Vision

This whole code base is adopted form "neuralearn.ai".

This was the start of my computer vision journey. I adopted Neuralearn Free Course of Computer Vision available on Youtube.
The best tip is to make notes in initial.
I have use "medium" alot for understanding a lot of concepts. I have read about 200+ articles throughout this course. You will enjoy this detailed 37 hours course alot.

I learned a lot form this course, objectives are shown below.

I think you need a lot of things as pre requisites for this course. 
  1. Good data Analysis skills and Machine Learning.
  2. Mathematical understanding of Neural Network.

# Things I learned:
  1. TensorFlow Library
  2. Data Handling & Data pipelines on Large Scale for various purpose.
  3. Used a lot of models (CNNs, Visions models, GradCam, YOLO)
  4. Studied Variety of metrices
  5. Used TensorBoard and W&B like tools for External Analysis (MLOPs)
